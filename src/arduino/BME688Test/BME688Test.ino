@section I2CDemo_intro_section Description

Example program for using I2C to set and read the Bosch BME680 sensor. The sensor measures
temperature, pressure and humidity and is described at
https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/bst/products/all_products/BME680. The datasheet is available from
Bosch at https://ae-bst.resource.bosch.com/media/_tech/media/datasheets/BST-BME680_DS001-11.pdf \n\n

The most recent version of the BME680 library is available at https://github.com/SV-Zanshin/BME680
and the documentation of the library as well as example programs are described in the project's wiki
pages located at https://github.com/SV-Zanshin/BME680/wiki. \n\n

The BME680 is an extremely small physical package that is so tiny as to be impossible to solder at
home, hence it will be used as part of a third-party breakout board. There are several such boards
available at this time, for example \n Company  | Link

\n\n

Bosch supplies sample software that runs on various platforms, including the Arduino family; this
can be downloaed at https://github.com/BoschSensortec/BSEC-Arduino-library . This software is part
of the Bosch "BSEC" (Bosch Sensortec Environmental Cluster) framework and somewhat bulky and
unwieldy for typical Arduino applications, hence the choice to make a more compact and rather less
abstract library.

This example program initializes the BME680 to use I2C for communications. The library does not
using floating point numbers to save on memory space and computation time. The values for
Temperature, Pressure and Humidity are returned in deci-units, e.g. a Temperature reading of "2731"
means "27.31" degrees Celsius. The display in the example program uses floating point for
demonstration purposes only.  Note that the temperature reading is generally higher than the ambient
temperature due to die and PCB temperature and self-heating of the element.\n\n

The pressure reading needs to be adjusted for altitude to get the adjusted pressure reading. There
are numerous sources on the internet for formulae converting from standard sea-level pressure to
altitude, see the data sheet for the BME180 on page 16 of
http://www.adafruit.com/datasheets/BST-BMP180-DS000-09.pdf. Rather than put a floating-point
function in the library which may not be used but which would use space, an example altitude
computation function has been added to this example program to show how it might be done.
